# Imperium - Single Page Application

Imperium is a chess-inspired strategy game web application, where players face eight powerful gladiators on an 8x8 board. Each gladiator has unique attack, defense and life skills, along with strategic moves like in chess. Players compete to eliminate all of the opponent's pieces, triggering exciting turn-based clashes (inspired by Yu Gi Oh!) when two gladiators meet on the board. Victory requires cunning, tactical planning and careful management of each gladiator's skills. Immerse yourself in this challenging strategy game and demonstrate your skill in the art of gladiatorial combat.
